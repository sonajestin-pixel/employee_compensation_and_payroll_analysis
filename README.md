# employee_compensation_and_payroll_analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes employee compensation data to understand salary distribution, overtime patterns, workforce structure and employment status trends. The objective is to derive actionable insights that support data-driven HR decision-making and strategic workforce planning.

## Data Preparation & Processing

The following steps were performed to ensure data quality and reliability:

- Imported and inspected the dataset using head(), shape, columns, info() and describe().
- Dropped irrelevant columns to improve analysis focus.
- Identified and handled missing values appropriately.
- Calculated percentage of null values for better understanding of data gaps.
- Checked for duplicate records (none found).
- Standardized and cleaned salary fields by removing invalid negative values.
- Verified unique values across categorical variables.
- Conducted structured Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Univariate Analysis
  - Bivariate Analysis
  - Multivariate Analysis

These steps ensured clean, consistent and analysis-ready data.

## Key Insights

### Workforce Structure
- Majority of employees fall within the mid-salary range ($30k–$120k).
- Salary distribution is positively skewed with a small group of high earners.
- Civil service employees represent a larger portion of the workforce.

### Compensation Patterns
- Higher-paid employees generally receive minimal overtime pay.
- Weak correlation between base salary and overtime pay.
- Moderate positive relationship between overtime and longevity pay.
- Salary distribution differs across employment categories, with high-value outliers in both.

### Employment Status & Retention
- Active employees have slightly higher median salaries.
- Termination percentage is relatively low, indicating workforce stability.
- Higher-paid employees appear more likely to remain active.
